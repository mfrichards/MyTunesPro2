# MyTunes Music Player

MyTunes Music Player is an Android app, originally available in Google Play Store from Jan 2012 â€“ Nov 2014. At the peak of its popularity in Nov 2014, it had over 20,000 active device installs, with an average Play Store rating of 4.07 (Lite version) and 4.20 (Pro version). For various reasons, I could no longer spend the time required to continually keep the app up-to-date, so it became necessary to retire it from the Google Play store.

While no new features are currently being added to the app, at the request of several users, I have maintained an updated release of the apk file, rebuilt from time to time to work with modern versions of Android.

Note that the Play Store version of the app had a "Lite" version (with limited features), and a "Pro" version that was free, but contained ads. There was also an "unlocker" app for purchase that would remove ads from the Pro version, and unlock all features. With version 2.0, the Lite version and unlocker app have been discontinued. The Pro version is now ad free, and available for download free of charge.

The latest release is version 2.0, Build 3912. You will find it in the "Releases" sub-folder. To install on your phone, download the apk and side-load it onto your device. See below for a list of features. A (somewhat outdated) user's manual can also be found in the "Docs" sub-folder.
